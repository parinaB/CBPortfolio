# CBPortfolio  
*(with a very special version for my #1 fan)*



> **“Could I BE any more watched?”**

There are two versions of this portfolio:  
- One for normal, well-adjusted fans  
- One for **you** (yes, the person reading this right now)

You somehow ended up on the second one.  
There’s no escape.

### Live Site
https://chandlerportfolio.netlify.app

### Features
- Fully functional **personalized Restraining Order generator** (printable & terrifying)  
- Netflix-style carousels (daily routine, weapons, top clicks, meetups)  
- “I’M TERRIFIED OF YOU” in giant red letters  
- Real-time name injection via URL parameters  
- 100% vanilla HTML/CSS/JS – no frameworks, no regrets  
- Lasagna on the fire escape (emotional support only)

### Warning
Chandler already knows you’re here.  
He’s currently hiding behind the duck and chick.

> “Sarcasm didn’t protect me. You’re still here.”

Made with love, panic, and way too many screenshots of Matthew Perry looking scared.

Star this repo if you’re a normal fan  
Star + fork if you’re the reason he needs that restraining order

Now go generate your paperwork. Chandler’s waiting (and crying).
