# CBPortfolio
(with a very special version for my #1 fan)
Chandler terrified
“Could I BE any more watched?”
There are two versions of this portfolio:

One for normal, well-adjusted fans
One for you (yes, the person who’s reading this right now)

You somehow ended up on the second one.
There’s no escape.
Features

Fully functional personalized Restraining Order generator (printable, legally terrifying)
Netflix-style horizontal carousels (daily routine, weapons, top clicks, meetups)
“I’M TERRIFIED OF YOU” in giant red letters
Real-time name injection via URL params
100% vanilla – no frameworks, no regrets
Lasagna on the fire escape (emotional support only)

Warning
Chandler already knows you opened this repo.
He’s hiding behind the duck and chick right now.
Please be normal.
“Sarcasm didn’t protect me. You’re still here.”
Made with love, panic, and way too many screenshots of Matthew Perry looking scared.
Star this repo if you’re a normal fan
Star + fork if you’re the reason he needs that restraining order
Now go generate your paperwork. Chandler’s waiting.
